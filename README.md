# Startalk - Solution for Instant Message

Communication is a fundamental need of humankind. – “Sapiens: A brief history of humankind”

Startalk is going to be a universal, high-performance IM software for business. Currently, there is a lack of open-sourced IM systems in the world. Startalk is changing this situation.

The predecessor of Startalk is Qtalk, which have ran smoothly in Qunar for more than 3 years. The core of Startalk plays a role of customer service tool in Qunar.

In other words, a single core has solved Qunar’s problem of communication internally and externally.

# How to Use

Startalk focuses on private deployment, which leads to the complexity of the log-in process of Startalk. Luckily, our team not only made the process of designing IM system easy, but also decrease the cost of it.

Usually, when you are going to use an app, there are three steps for you to get access to it:
-	Download the app
-	Modify settings based on guide
-	Sign-up & Log-in

However, since Startalk focuses on private deployment, the server of app needs to be deployed in your company. Therefore, there are four steps for you to get access to Startalk:
-	Download the app
-	Deploy the backstage system
-	Modify client app through backstage configuration
-	Import accounts & Log-in

If you want to try private deployment without cost, you can try it in public domain

If you have decided to use [private deployment](https://github.com/qunarcorp/ejabberd) or transfer your data from public to private domain.. Let’s begin!

## Decentralized Design and the Way of Deployment
![architecture](image/sequence1.png)

1.	Separations between each domain
2.	Users are connected to domains
3.	Domain can be enlarged horizontally
4.	Public can be used by multiple domains

The design of Startalk is decentralized, which integrated non-state service into public and state service into domains. 

![architecture](image/sequence2.png)

As long as you have a server, you can deploy an IM system in your home!!
